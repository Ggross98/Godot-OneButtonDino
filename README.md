# Overview
* One-Button-Dino is a 2-player casual game salute to the Micro Battles series made by [Donut Games](https://www.donutgames.com/).  
* I made One-Button-Dino to practice developing games using Godot 4 engine with C#.  
* To play it, you can download the release file or view my [itch page](https://ggross.itch.io/one-button-dino).
## How to play
* Each player has only one button to control: Z and slash (/ and ?), respectively. When you click the button, you will throw the sword when holding one, or jump when nothing is in hand.

* When you hurt by the sword, your opponent will get one score. Try to win more points!
