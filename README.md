# Overview
One-Button-Dino is a 2-player casual game salute to the Micro Battles series made by [Donut Games](https://www.donutgames.com/). Made with Godot 4 and C#.
## How to play
* Each player has only one button to control: Z and slash (/ and ?), respectively. When you click the button, you will throw the sword when holding one, or jump when nothing is in hand.
